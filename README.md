Restaurant Page
This is a "Sandwich restaurants website", that is built completely by creating the DOM elements in Javascript and Webpack. This is a simple exercise to develop and demonstrate my understanding of Webpack and ES6 modules.
To install and run this project, make sure you have NPM installed, type "npm install" followed by "npm run build". This will install the projects dependicies with their latest versions and bundle the code into some manageable files found in the dist folder. Make sure to use the dist folder, not the src folder!
